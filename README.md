# Hey, I’m Fakhri Kubysheva

I’m a developer and student passionate about building technology that solves real problems — especially where empathy, design, and code come together.

I’ve worked on everything from an AR learning platform for children with autism to eco-focused apps that nudge behavior change. For me, tech isn’t just about features — it’s about impact.

Currently, I'm diving into iOS development using Swift and SwiftUI, while continuing to explore real-time AI and accessible design for mobile experiences.
